1bk58ru,"My first baby was born after a long old 36 hour labour that dragged on with a lot of grunting at home before heading into the delivery suite for a midwife led procedure. So I was naive to assume although second babies come faster, that it would still be probably something like 12 hours (I did a ton of scrolling old Reddit threads reading other people's experiences). Baby was running late so yesterday at 3pm I went for a sweep and the midwife after trying, looked at me and said ""you're not even dilated, we will have to book you in for an induction at the weekend."" Not a problem - sounds like a plan I can organise for. At 2am I wake up sharply to one almighty contraction and my waters breaking all over the bed. Stupid me thinking - I still have plenty of time, I'll get up and walk around and sort out the toddlers stuff for the family member coming to look after her. I had an hour of close together contractions and I suddenly became aware of the fact that I hadn't considered a fast labour... Cut to: me delivering my own freaking 8.6 lb baby on my bathroom floor after nearly giving birth on the toilet at 4am whilst paramedics sprinted through the door just in time to see me catch her on the dirty laundry I'd knocked out of the laundry basket, whilst my partner was wrestling with the toddler to keep her away. I lock eyes with the paramedic and he just says ""baby?"" And I say ""yes."" 
All is good with baby and we are now resting in the hospital but it still doesn't feel real! 
 So the moral of my story is - don't be an arse like me and pay attention to your contractions!

1bm36ak,"Went to bed around 11 after bub had his bottle/diaper change/swaddle routine. Then suddenly it was 9 AM and I shot up in bed realizing I hadn't heard him cry the entire night. He was still peacefully snoozing.

For context, my husband and I take turns with him throughout the night, but every time he cries I still wake up because I'm such a light sleeper and too paranoid something is wrong. 

I'll admit, I thought I did it. Somehow my magical parenthood prowess and innate psychological connection with him, along with our groundbreaking bedtime routine of bottle, diaper, swaddle which no one has ever thought of before was clearly the magic touch to securing a full night's rest at 5 weeks old. I poured him an extra ounce in the bottle to celebrate.

Then my husband rolled over and said ""don't worry, I got all his bottles and diapers last night, you were just too zonked and didn't realize"".

I usually have NO stomach issues and last night i was hit with the craziest CONTRACTION like pain. my 11mo was asleep in my arms and i set her in her crib and ran to the bathroom. while on the toilet i can see her crib from my room and i saw her waking up and she absolutely lost her mind while i was in the worst of it and literally felt like i was going to pass out. i knew she was safe and honestly she was safer than me at this point.

Honestly never had to go to the bathroom so bad and so dramatically, i was making noises like i did in labor.

Anyways , about 30 mins later i get a knock on my door from the police doing a wellness check because people thought i was endangering my baby or hitting her. i kindly let them in and told them the embarrassing story but idk why i feel so guilty , i know she‚Äôs fine and i did nothing but i hate the thought that someone was worried about that.

1brvfep,"I was angry at you today. You asked me to go pick up our oldest from their grandparents because you were meeting up with a friend. That's okay. I'm more than willing, but you assumed I'd be taking the baby with me. You didn't ask, just assumed. But you had a while child free day yesterday when you went golfing with your buddies. Why do you need more child free time when I get so little?

I'm not angry about the golfing, I'm angry at the assumption. I'm angry that when you have a surprise day off, your first thought isn't, ""let me go pick up the baby from the sitter to spend time with her and take something off my wife's plate.""

2 weeks ago you didn't have power at work, you went home and played video games, I was still at work, and our baby was still at the sitter. Why didn't you pick her up? Do you see her as only my responsibility?

1bnfst8,"Mine is that part of the reason newborns cry is that they're hormonal, but no one talks about that.

1bqtnfg,"It's a frequent topic in this sub that healthcare for women kinda sucks. But since we aren't widely advertising to our family and friends that my husband has a vasectomy, I need to vent here. 

I am a FTM and I had an emergency c-section 4 months ago. Not even 36 hours later, I'm eating dinner in my room and the nurse comes in, says ""you're doing well so you're being discharged after you're done eating,"" and hands me discharge papers. All those papers said was ""follow up with your obstetrician in 6-8 weeks. If you have any s******* thoughts, call your doctor immediately."" Nothing on pain management. Nothing on what to expect, what's normal, etc. 

My husband had a vasectomy done on Monday. Not only did he watch a video after the procudure, but he also received a handout and email copy of after care instructions, pain relief and management options, and a list of what's normal and what's not post-procedure. For a no scapel vasectomy!! He has a tiny little incision, yet I was a FTM mom, had a 17 cm cut in my abdomen that spanned 7 layers of tissue, and they just sent me home. 

I had to spend a lot of time in the weeks after I returned home, googling ""is X normal after a c-section?"" üôÑ It's major abdominal surgery!!

That‚Äôs not to say I will *never* care about your relationship with my kid. I want him to grow up and have a lot of good relationships with family and friends that he can rely on and I recognize how important it is and how lucky we are to have that. But he‚Äôs almost 6 months old and I am tired. I‚Äôm burnt out. I love every moment but I‚Äôm also still not getting the sleep I need, still don‚Äôt have time for myself or to get enough things done around the house. Every time we have visitors it is always an effort to coordinate around naps and deal with an overwhelmed and overstimulated baby. And these visits aren‚Äôt support visits, but visits to spend some quality time with and build a relationship with him. 
‚ÄúI miss him!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs growing up so fast!‚Äù 
I get that, but right now I‚Äôm still just scraping by and making space for you and your needs (x every family member or friend) just isn‚Äôt doing it for me right now. Sorry. 

Edit: wow, this blew up more than I expected. Really comforting to know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way and actually how common it is! To those who feel saddened by my lack of willingness to have family around please understand that I love my family and also love having them around, but that in the early stages of being a FTM more often than not, that means spending the little amount of energy I have left trying to facilitate a relationship to the detriment of my own well-being. The best thing for my son right now is a mom who isn‚Äôt using the last of her energy making other people happy, but spending it on taking care of herself and being the best mom I can be. 

This wasn‚Äôt meant to be a post to say family and friends are barred from forming a relationship with my baby, but that simply admitting that in this specific state of fatigue - I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just nice to take the weight off for a while of trying to please everyone during a time that feels trying and almost impossible. 

Some of you have families that give you energy, that make these difficult times a little easier, and who understand that family visits aren‚Äôt just for the visitor, but as a means of support and a way for families to become closer. I love this notion and I have a few family members who do just that, and I am very grateful. And those family members do inevitable see my baby the most often because it works for us. But for the relatives who only leave us feeling more obligated and more drained for the purpose of their own wants and needs, this was just a rant to give myself a little permission to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù and it felt really good. ","If I could go back I‚Äôd just ask for more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so exhausted, can you bring food from x?

It‚Äôs a lot easier to smile at someone when you‚Äôre exhausted if they‚Äôre coming to your door with food or they‚Äôre folding the baby‚Äôs socks. I look back on visitors who brought food with fondness and I shouldn‚Äôt have been afraid to ask. 

So I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt be shy to ask, get something for yourself out of it and also you‚Äôll build less resentment in the long term. It‚Äôs also ok to just be tired and not have the mental energy for it, too.

1c0229b,"So I‚Äôve only met my neighbor once. Yesterday she came by again and I heard her through the window. She asked if she could see my son and I said sure because I wasn‚Äôt busy. I got up to use the restroom and put some proper clothes on. 

I hear her literally walk in talking and I pull my pants up as quick as I can I didn‚Äôt even get to wipe. Mind you I was even using the restroom with the door open because well this is my home. She walks past the bathroom into my bedroom where my son is and I shit you not she picks my baby up. 

I‚Äôm frozen at this point and very confused. I‚Äôm also pregnant so I‚Äôm scared to even say anything to this person. We had the door unlocked because my husband was doing a few things out front so she must of snuck by him and let herself in. 

Anyways I tell her like ‚Äúumm let‚Äôs go outside?‚Äù. So she goes. I ask my husband if he let her in and he said no. He said he thought I let her in because he only saw her when she was walking out. 

She proceeds to tell us how we can just give her a key to our apartment and she‚Äôll take care of my son and pet when I go into labor. I told her I have my dad coming and to not worry about it. Does she think I‚Äôll just leave to the hospital and leave my son here alone? Worse case scenario I would give birth alone and my husband would stay in waiting room with LO. 

All while essentially bragging that she did over 10 years in prison. She doesn‚Äôt get to see her grandkids and hasn‚Äôt done drugs ‚Äúin a long time‚Äù. She keeps calling my husband her son and that she loves him. He just says ‚Äúalright‚Äù because he‚Äôs  uncomfortable. He already told her you‚Äôre not my mom. 

My husband is going to talk to her today to not do this again. We were both in shock when it happened and didn‚Äôt know what to say. We‚Äôre also alerting the property manager and our neighbors. The neighbors said they‚Äôll keep an eye out for me as well.

1bptg6i,"I've been feeling this way for a while now but this was really solidified for me recently when I flew from Manchester Airport with my 1 year old and (just turned) 3 year old.

I had a double stroller with both my littles strapped in. I went to security. Previously i haf flown from Istanbul airport where they had a special security for families with children under 5. There the staff help you, hold your babies and it is stress free. 

Not here though. It was insanely busy and noisy, already both kids were already crying.  I had to put my jacket, liquids and electrical items in a separate tray on the conveyor belt, fine. But then, they expect you to take your children out of the stroller, somehow stop them from running off, fold the stroller yourself and lift it onto the conveyor belt yourself. Am I an octopus??? Staff refused to help. In the end a fellow passenger helped me lift it onto thr conveyor belt whilst I desperately tried to hold onto my kids, squeezing them between my legs. I burst into tears when this absolute stranger came and offered a hand.

And at least my kids can stand. What about babies? One woman was travelling alone with her baby who was around 3 months old. Where was she supposed to put her baby whilst collapsing and opening her stroller? The floor?! When I finally got my kids back in my stroller, I held this stranger's baby whilst she had to grapple with opening her stroller back up. 

I noticed security were SO helpful to people on mobility scooters - as they should be. Letting them go through scanners in the scooters. But no such considerations were given to parents with strollers. Surely hundreds of parents, babies and toddlers fly every day. Why does no one care?

It got me thinking about how so many other places are so hostile to babies and toddlers. How parents are magically supposed to navigate daily life when no other considerations are made. 

Am I the only one who feels this way?",You are absolutely right and it is so sad. I traveled alone with my baby often and had to get a stroller that you could fold up with one hand (the city mini). I used to work with elderly adults with limited mobility and I noticed that many places are hostile to them as well.

My colleagues have been very happy to see me and have been very interested in the baby and my experiences. Which is lovely. However‚Ä¶

I keep getting asked ‚ÄúDid you have a natural birth?‚Äù  I know what they mean. They want to know if I had a vaginal birth. And I don‚Äôt mind personal questions like that. I‚Äôm a pretty open person. 

But the question sucks. I hate that term. ‚ÄúNatural birth‚Äù. What is an unnatural birth? Aliens hopped up on GMOs did an intergalactic ritual and teleported the baby out of me? Like, ok, I had a c section. At the strong advice of my MFM and OB to keep both baby and me safe. Was it surgical? Yes. Was it unnatural? I don‚Äôt think so. 

The question has serious implications of how people view c sections. And it‚Äôs annoying. Are people just too afraid to say the word ‚Äúvaginal‚Äù?

I personally just hate the use of the word ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù, because technically everything is chemicals. Water, natural ingredients, salt, vitamins etc. are all ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù. Plus natural doesn‚Äôt always mean safer (the most toxic substances known come from plants), and synthetic doesn‚Äôt always mean harmful. I don‚Äôt think the problem is with parents wanting some control over what they use with their babies (that‚Äôs perfectly reasonable). The problem is it‚Äôs companies will take advantage to make a lot of money off ‚Äúnatural‚Äù products that are twice as expensive and not any safer."
1bpbv7h,"My MIL keeps telling us to take her the baby for a ‚Äúdate night break.‚Äù She won‚Äôt come here because she doesn‚Äôt like to drive. She keeps insisting like she‚Äôs offering a huge favor but she really isn‚Äôt. We‚Äôd have to drive the baby across town, take a change of clothes, diapers, wipes, a pumped bottle, a changing pad and a bassinet since she has nowhere to safely lay the baby down. 

Even if someone watches the baby at our house it still isn‚Äôt really that helpful. My parents watched the baby at our house a few weeks ago so my hubby and I could go to dinner and for a walk. It was nice to get out by ourselves, but I still had to pump a bottle before we left, then I had to pump afterwards since the baby was full. Pumping is a lot of work! Plus all we did the whole time was talk about the baby and how we missed her. 

My mom suggested to me the other day that I  leave the baby with them for 8 hours so I could get used to being away from my baby and to see how I handle separation since I return to work in a few weeks. How is that helpful?? I‚Äôm going to have to get used to it very soon anyway and what if I can‚Äôt handle it? What am I really going to do about it, quit my job?

In your writing I can feel the love and support you have for your husband, but damn doesn't it just feel unfair sometimes? 

I don't resent that my husband goes to the gym 3-5 times a week, I resent that I have to ask for any time I get to myself. 

I resent that it's assumed I've got the kids when he's getting ready for work, but when I'm getting ready for work, he will walk in the door 2 minutes after I need to leave which leaves me no time to communicate any of their needs, nevermind mine. 

I resent that every decision I make factors in the needs of the other 3 people in my house,  when it feels like most of his world is still his own."

1c350lv,"Thats what my husband has said to me a couple of times now and it leaves me answer-less. 

Im a FTM, SAHM to an 8 month old boy. And almost everyday feels like im fighting a loosing battle against my home disintegrating into chaos. 

There's always dirty laundry, the kitchen seems perpetually dirty, sometimes I forget to feed the dog. My legs and armpits are a complete forest and my nails are raggedy. The minute I put on clean clothes, they get milk or food smeared on them. The floors haven't been washed in god-knows how long and the cupboards and closets are a disorganized mess. 

But yet I spend almost every waking moment trying to get stuff done. Sure, sometimes I take 10 minutes to exercise and I will scroll reddit and watch youtube while my baby is breastfeeding. But can I not have any time AT ALL to chill or do something that I want to do??

I am floundering, but I am trying to do my best. I am trying to be the best mom I can be to my son. I cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I exercise the dog. I run errands. I go to baby music circle and story time a couple times a week. I have no support system, it's all me.

But that's literally all I can do, I am operating at maximum capacity, and it feels like I have nothing to show for it and I have accomplished nothing. 

My husband will come home from work and ask me ""what did I do all day?"" If the kitchen is dirty. He will complain that laundry doesn't smell fresh enough or there's still spots in the clothes. He will complain that the car is dirty, ask why I haven't called the insurance company, and then comment that the kitchen trash is full. 

 I tell him that I AM cleaning but its impossible to do everything and then he will hit me with the line ""how do other women do it?"" And I honestly have no idea. 

How DO other women do it?? Am I missing something here? I have only ONE baby and I don't have a job. How on earth do other women do it?? 

This is a huge point of contention with my husband. Do any other women who have dealt with a similar issue have any advice? I feel like he doesn't value the sacrifices I have made and all the work I do. When I get angry and start arguing with him he just rescinds, apologizes, and tries to help for like 20 minutes but then it will happen again the next week, so I think he fundamentally believes that taking care of a baby and keeping house is a simple, easy task, and that I spend all day dilly dallying.

My mother recalls horrible, simply horrible summers of all the family children working there nonstop. From taking care of the animals to washing everything perfectly to making butter old fashioned way to helping with the small children to weeding the veggie garden. 

Food was served just as much as needed, people had one plate that they needed to wash for themselves and there were no such things as 12 sides and what not served on nice plates and bowls. Meals were simple. Soup. Bread, butter and cheese. Hard boiled eggs and so on. It‚Äôs much easier to wash one plate for yourself and one pot of soup as opposed to what we are used to now- chopping bord, salad bowl, side plates, wine glasses and water glasses, potato dish and so on and then oven sheets, pan and pot, chefs knife and blah blah blah. My grandma literally used one knife to peel the vegetables and would chop the ingredients straight to the pot of soup -no chopping board. 

Windows were cleaned in spring time as well as all the bed linen washed around easter time. All the linens were organized for the following year. Bed linens were washed less often than we do it now especially in winter times. 

It was absolutely expected that everyone in the family will help. Even toddlers were expected to feed the chicks. 

The house was made of wood entirely and that is literally impossible to actually clean. You can mop for sure, but you will not expect to clean all the nooks and crannies. No spider webs and socks don‚Äôt stick? Good enough! Our case is different as we have polished woods and tile that needs to be perfectly perfect. 

She breastfed and co-slept with all her children. Unfortunately, babies were also tied to trees while left alone while she was working. That was the way of keeping them ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. My grandmother recalls my mother and her twin sister eating earth worms they dug up while tied somewhere in the gardens. Children crying was a total norm. It was considered that alive, fed, dressed and healthy baby is totally enough. They did not know about emotional needs children have, nor they had the time to care.

Long story short, I am the first generation of healed children in that family. Being tied to a tree crying for (possibly) hours definitely made them all insecure, some worse than others. 

Oh and my great grandmother was 16 when she married and got pregnant so it‚Äôs not like she had any capacity to even start understanding complex children psychologically. She knew that as long as a kid is clean and fed she did her job well. As I understand she considered herself a model mother, wife and woman. And I am sure she was. Just if she lived in our times she would go to damn jail for neglect and abandonment of children."

I'm overwhelmed with the whole thing and just want to ignore my birthday now. Why couldn't he just plan it? Not sure. It's up to me.  He called on his lunch just to talk since he's been trying to reconnect with me. Our conversation turned into me crying and trying to explain the mental load I carry. Examples: if I didn't pay rent, it wouldn't get paid and he wouldn't even know, if I didn't ask him to do laundry it wouldn't get done, we would run out of essentials like detergent, toilet paper, and diapers, our weekly meals wouldnt get planned and none of our bills would be paid. These sort of things that I just automatically do behind the scenes. He obviously got offended and told me to write him a list because he ""can't read my mind""  and I said ""ok I'll just add that to the list of other things I do. Not sure why you need a list. Don't you know what needs to get done around here?"". This is a common household problem so I've read. It feels overwhelming to even have to delegate this stuff. Sure, I could write a list.

I would rather regret not having children than regret having children. 
A child will change everything. Your whole life will revolve around them. Yes you can take them with you with a lot of things. But you‚Äôll always think about their needs first. Being pregnant and giving birth are not walks in the park. I gained weight I can‚Äôt seem to loose. I have stretchmarks, my skin is saggy and so are my boobs. My body will never go back to the way it was before. I had a very decent birthstory. I did it while sitting in a bath and without medication while being induced. I feel like a lot of women are not prepared very well or are made to fear giving birth. But to be honest, it was one of the most powerful things I have done. 

Ofcourse having kids is not only bad. Every morning I get a very cute ‚Äò hi mommy, how did you sleep?‚Äô. When I pick him up from daycare he runs into my arms like I‚Äôm the most special place in the world. His farts are deadly but hilarious. It‚Äôs an honour to be his mom and to raise him, to watch him grow and see the kid he‚Äôs turning into. He has my weird sense of humor, has a smile that lights up a room and when he cries I want to rip my heart out because it hurts so much. 

To some it up: being a parents is awful, hard, difficult, weird, discusting, beautiful, special, funny, heartwarming and rewarding.

       Like if I take a 30 min shower or do self care or have a social life I'm suddenly abandoning my kid . And also ppl without kids seems to have the strongest opinions are parenting .

Then today, out of the blue during the afternoon, she stoped being responsive and started seizing with saliva coming out of her month.

As far as I see on MayoClinic 
‚ÄúMost febrile seizures produce no lasting effects. Simple febrile seizures don't cause brain damage, intellectual disability or learning disabilities, and they don't mean your child has a more serious underlying disorder.‚Äù

I noticed our 2 day old baby was doing some noisy breathing. My husband noticed baby‚Äôs feet and hands were grayish blue.
We  freaked out and called the after hours service from our pediatrician, who sent us to the emergency room.
His vitals were great, and they told us the noisy breathing was normal. As for the color of his feet? Turns out that was just his skin beginning to get darker.
250 dollars for them to basically say‚Ä¶ your baby is black! üò≠ü§£

1c4hagk,"I use to get so upset with you when you insisted to continue doing things for me after a certain age. Without asking or me saying anything you would take it upon yourself to do my laundry, tidy my room, pick up after me. I would always get mad because I felt like you were impeding my independence. I can wash my own clothes, I can make my own bed, I‚Äôm old enough to do it I don‚Äôt need you to do it for me. You occasionally brought up things like how important it was to talk about my feelings and how I need to be mindful of this or that. I would get annoyed because I didn‚Äôt want to be lectured. Without you I realized you didn‚Äôt do things for me because you thought I was incapable or needed help, you did it because you wanted to. Because you love me. I realized you weren‚Äôt trying to lecture me but remind me that you care and it‚Äôs ok to talk about your feelings and not shut people out. I still regret not saying anything to you the last time I saw you, I was just going to work and we hugged and said I love you frequently, I thought to stop and tell you I loved you but I didn‚Äôt because I was just going to work.. I still remember your voice, your hugs, I remember your perfume and your smile. I still send you messages even after all these years, a part of me wishes you‚Äôll respond or the message will get marked as ‚Äúseen‚Äù i remember your voice but I wish I could hear it again, I remember your perfume but I wish I could smell it again, I remember your hugs, they were the greatest hugs I‚Äôve ever received, no one else‚Äôs comes close. I wish I asked you more questions about your life, your thoughts, your memories. I wish I had been more open with you about my feelings and what I was going through, good and bad. I still feel your presence sometimes, a week or two after I last saw you I dreamed about you, I knew I was dreaming, I felt like I could‚Äôve asked you anything and you would‚Äôve responded but I didn‚Äôt want to waste time talking so I just hug you and cried, we hugged for the entire dream without a word, I wanted to hold onto that feeling as long as I could. I didn‚Äôt want to wake up. You taught me how to love, love isn‚Äôt helping someone with the expectation they‚Äôll pay you back, it‚Äôs helping someone because you love them and you want to make sure they are alright. It‚Äôs staying calm when someone is upset to let them know you are listening to them and you care. It‚Äôs doing something for someone not to win them over but to let them know you thought of them and remind them you care. Love is not manipulative or greedy or selfish. You also taught me how to stand up for myself, loving someone doesn‚Äôt mean letting them walk on you or take advantage of you. You are the strongest person I‚Äôve ever known. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this or how to end it, I‚Äôve just been thinking about you a lot lately and I needed to vent openly without everyone in my life trying to check in on me. I‚Äôm ok, I‚Äôm happy mostly, I‚Äôve grown and achieved things I am proud of. I wish you could‚Äôve seen my achievements. I love you so much and I miss you everyday. I‚Äôm sorry for the trouble I caused and for the times I got mad at you. I‚Äôm sorry for not letting you in on how I was feeling, how I struggled with depression, how harshly I judged and hated myself. I‚Äôm sorry for judging you when I was too young to know better.  You have always been my angel, I wish I realized that while I still had you. You are my motivation for bettering myself, you would‚Äôve wanted me to keep trying and improving. I am learning how to love myself and how to stop my emotions from controlling me. I don‚Äôt know if I love myself enough yet to do this all for me but I know you would want me to so I will continue to improve and try for you. ","This is absolutely beautiful , I am in BITS!

1bsvu66,"12 days after giving birth to our first child, my wife suffered a fatal blood clot. I spent the last nine months reading posts here and thinking about all the challenges my wife and I had ahead of us, but I was never really worried, because we were a great team. I was so excited to see my wife become the most amazing mother. We spent hours talking about the future, about the things we would teach our son, about the experiences we would share.

I am now a widower, and a single father to a newborn. I am broken. There are a million scenarios running through my head, and in none of them can I do this without her. My wife gave my life purpose. The loneliness I feel is unlike anything I could have ever imagined. I love my son, and I will do everything in my power to raise him in a way that would make my wife proud, but in this moment, that feels impossible.

I'm not really sure what the purpose of this post is. If anyone has any suggestions on how I could possibly move forward, I am all ears.

1bngjju,"If your baby sits up on their own, the grocery store is an amazing activity. Here are my tips/ reasons.


- park next to the cart corral

- do a short list the first time 

- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. ""This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it."" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. 

- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.

- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. 

- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. 

- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public

- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of ""man hours"" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff. See how that ""opens"" another hour in the schedule?","Kind of relevant. I had an elderly lady, at least in her 80s, come up to me and my 7 month old the other day at the grocery store. She stopped a couple of feet away (I was so afraid it was going to be one of those, ""Please don't touch him"" situations, but thankfully not!).

1bz1opq,"I nurse my baby to sleep about three times a day. He‚Äôs about a year old now. And for most of this time, I would just wait for him to fall asleep, then put him in his crib, and go.

I didn‚Äôt feel the starry eyed amazing love when he was born, but the love has been growing steadily as he does too. I think I had PPD, and it was very hard for me to connect in the beginning.

Recently my husband came in to transfer baby from the bed to the crib, kissed him on the forehead, and said ‚Äúgood night baby, sleep well‚Äù. And I realized‚Ä¶I never do that. I do kiss him and love him so much at other times, but not good night. I guess because he‚Äôs asleep and doesn‚Äôt notice, because he‚Äôs still so small that he won‚Äôt remember, and because I hadn‚Äôt realized I could or should. But I started doing it every time he falls asleep with me and my heart feels so much warmer and my love cup fills up so much faster since I started.

So if you don‚Äôt, for whatever reason, just start kissing your baby good night, it‚Äôs amazing!","Pretty much every morning until I moved out of my parents‚Äô house at 18, my dad would try to sneak into my room and give me a kiss on my forehead before he left for work early in the morning.

Food was served just as much as needed, people had one plate that they needed to wash for themselves and there were no such things as 12 sides and what not served on nice plates and bowls. Meals were simple. Soup. Bread, butter and cheese. Hard boiled eggs and so on. It‚Äôs much easier to wash one plate for yourself and one pot of soup as opposed to what we are used to now- chopping bord, salad bowl, side plates, wine glasses and water glasses, potato dish and so on and then oven sheets, pan and pot, chefs knife and blah blah blah.

1blrj5h,"Like don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not gonna be throwing acid and cleaners on my child lol, but on tiktok and Reddit I just see so many people go ‚Äúoh but the chemicals!!!!‚Äù To even the most basic things like baby shampoo and whatnot. 

I think it‚Äôs good to be aware of what your putting on your baby, but sometimes it just seems like it goes too far. No, this baby shampoo isn‚Äôt going to cause issues to your kid because it has an ingredient that you don‚Äôt know in it. No, your baby isn‚Äôt going to get a chemical burn because you used Nair for two seconds to get a hair tourniquet off. 

I know going all natural is a trend now, and I have nothing against it if you wanna use all natural for your child, but why are some people acting like we‚Äôre torturing our children because we use Johnson and Johnson lotion. 

I have a feeling this is an unpopular opinion and really I‚Äôm not trying to attack anyone. I just genuinely don‚Äôt understand why all natural is the top standard and anything else is just doing wrong by your child. Even for adults, sometimes people need the sulphates and stuff in shampoo for their hair! Just because it‚Äôs not all natural doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad ya know? ","I generally agree, although like you said it‚Äôs good to be aware of things. I personally just hate the use of the word ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù, because technically everything is chemicals. Water, natural ingredients, salt, vitamins etc. are all ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù.

As far as I see on MayoClinic 
‚ÄúMost febrile seizures produce no lasting effects. Simple febrile seizures don't cause brain damage, intellectual disability or learning disabilities, and they don't mean your child has a more serious underlying disorder.‚Äù

I am also guessing it‚Äôs febrile since your baby had a fever before. I might be wrong because I am not a doctor but I think maybe it will ease your mind."
1bj4qaw,"Our LO is 4 weeks old, so we are in the trenches of the newborn phase. And going through this, I‚Äôll never understand how people can have more than one kid. 

Why do they want to go through this again? How do they handle this while also taking care of other kids? 

Pregnancy, labor, and delivery were all easier than this. 

I am so lucky because my husband has 6 weeks off work and I have 12, plus I can work remote when needed. But I‚Äôm exclusively breastfeeding (pumping on occasion so he can feed her) so the sleep deprivation and physical exhaustion is so real. 

We thought we might want two kids, but I can‚Äôt imagine having another child to care for while caring for a newborn. 


","There was no way I was thinking about another kid at 4 weeks pp. It took me about a year to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Your first born will be more independent. They smile and laugh and are alive to the world. 

Then the 2nd one comes. While the baby stuff feels easier this time around, you deal with navigating the dynamic with 2 kids. It took me a little longer to get adjusted (18 months). 

Now they‚Äôre best friends. Play together. Laugh together. 

Wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way.

Edit to add: Each stage is temporary, including the one you and I are on now. Your feelings may change once it passes. Either way, give yourself grace since you and little babe are both learning.

I would rather regret not having children than regret having children. 
A child will change everything. Your whole life will revolve around them. Yes you can take them with you with a lot of things. But you‚Äôll always think about their needs first. Being pregnant and giving birth are not walks in the park. I gained weight I can‚Äôt seem to loose. I have stretchmarks, my skin is saggy and so are my boobs. My body will never go back to the way it was before. I had a very decent birthstory. I did it while sitting in a bath and without medication while being induced. I feel like a lot of women are not prepared very well or are made to fear giving birth. But to be honest, it was one of the most powerful things I have done. 

Ofcourse having kids is not only bad. Every morning I get a very cute ‚Äò hi mommy, how did you sleep?‚Äô. When I pick him up from daycare he runs into my arms like I‚Äôm the most special place in the world. His farts are deadly but hilarious. It‚Äôs an honour to be his mom and to raise him, to watch him grow and see the kid he‚Äôs turning into. He has my weird sense of humor, has a smile that lights up a room and when he cries I want to rip my heart out because it hurts so much. 

To some it up: being a parents is awful, hard, difficult, weird, discusting, beautiful, special, funny, heartwarming and rewarding. 

Sorry for the long read but I hope it helps"
1bnfhxu,"I gave birth last Saturday. It was 40 hours, and I got through it fine. When they put the baby on me for skin on skin, I just said, ""Oh, you're here."" I figured the response - no tears, no real reaction was just because I was in labor for 40 hours and tired. 

I thought at some point I would get the whole ""I can't believe I love this baby this much feeling,"" but it hasn't come. My husband broke down when we got home from the hospital, was just so proud, we hugged for like 10 minutes as I wiped his tears and told him what a great dad he was going to be and he is absolutely wonderful. 

I don't feel depressed, I don't feel- really anything. Every day, I just do the things I'm supposed to be doing and go through the motions. He's a fussy baby, but I have all the patients in the world. I am reading all the development milestones, talking to him, playing some Hans Zimmer and Max Richter, we swing, do the breastfeeding and pumping, constant diaper changes, he eats like a champion already consuming 3-4oz at 8 days old, just ordered some high contrast toys and grippy ball thing for him to try and grab during tummy time (Ped already recommended it as he can hold his neck up no problem). 

But after all this, I just look at him and feel nothing. My mom asked me today if I ever thought I could love something so much, and I honestly didn't know how to answer. Makes me feel bad and kind of sad. Did this come later for anyone? I know people get PPD, but I don't feel depressed. üòï ","I felt the same way, and felt so guilty.

1buwap3,"Just something to get off my chest, partially humorous but there's a serious side too.

Have been coming here since baby was very young, desperately looking for help as a first time father with a very difficult, high needs, sleep-training-resistant bad sleeper that drove me and my wife up the wall for her entire first year.

Now that she's a toddler and we're finally starting to stabilize (some good days at least), I still try to drop by from time to time and I still see the big thing that irked me, both on here and other similar subs.

Basically, what will happen is someone will come in looking for help with a specific scenario. Let's get real here - 75% of the time it's sleep, sometimes relationships.

The problem?

Rather than responding with specific advice, there is a tendency to say something to the effect of ""oh what really helped me was reading this ESSENTIAL book called A - you'll see what I mean when you read that book. No, I'm not telling you why lol"". There will often be books B-Z too.

I often wonder just how much time and disposable income other parents have, but even now I have zero time to read an article, let alone a whole book and I'm not exactly flush with book money either...

I'm willing to be charitable and assume these aren't paid advertisements for said materials, but...why not just state the handful of tips you learned from said books that would help the poster in question - chances are, if they are in the 0-12 month trenches, they aren't really going to have time to dig through themselves.

Anyway, food for thought.

EDIT: Well, this blew up and the comments here...are sort of what I'm talking about. No, telling someone \*what\* you learned from Precious Little Sleep in a few points is not them 'cheating' and asking for help that doesn't involve buying and reading a whole book is not 'entitlement'.

We got to the ER at the same time. They called us back immediately because she was combative and they couldn‚Äôt calm her down. We weren‚Äôt prepared. A dozen people in the room. Her face completely swollen and scraped. They had to cut her clothes off because they couldn‚Äôt actually tell what was injured and she was completely incoherent.

They did chest X-rays and took a full body CT scan. Somehow it all came back positive. No brain bleeding, no internal organ damage (besides the severe concussion), the only broken bone was a small fracture in her thumb.

Shortly after, the owner of the ski hill called. He was worried because they found the helmet completely shattered. We told the doctor about the helmet and he said it was obvious she was wearing it or we‚Äôd be having a very different, very difficult discussion right now.

I‚Äôm sitting on the couch talking with her right now. She‚Äôs sore but she‚Äôs going to be okay. Without the helmet, she probably wouldn‚Äôt be here today.

1brqtpw,"This is the third Easter with my kid, the first one where he can actually do stuff. (US post so obviously this is going to be about consumerism)

We were invited to a little church egg hunt from a family friend and were just like, hey why not? We were told to bring a basket and 6 eggs. Cool. 

We get there and there‚Äôs maybe 12-15 kids, ages from 2-12. My son was the only 2 year old. I think that‚Äôs a good size and lets my son have some interaction with others. The church also was donated some eggs, so there were over EIGHT HUNDRED eggs just thrown in the yard. Plenty for a little dude to grab while the bigger kids go get the harder to get eggs, right?

1st mistake was they didn‚Äôt separate by ages, so all kids were out simultaneously. 2nd mistake was they were giving CASH prizes for the most eggs found?? I have never heard of this. The biggest thing I‚Äôve ever seen was like a ‚Äúprize egg‚Äù where one egg is filled with a few dollars. But I guess the cash prizes was just a thing for this place. 

Anyways, my son was the first to go out just by where we were in line so he was able to grab 2-3 while the rest of the kids were foaming at the mouth to get outside. After that, every time he reached for a little egg some little 8-9 year old would snatch it from his fingers ü•∫ I eventually said ‚Äúhey. Let the baby grab a few eggs please‚Äù and the other parents would scoff and tell their kids to get them all. I should have been a bitch but I‚Äôve never been here before and was invited by a church member. 

There was thankfully a basketball court that had a fence and a few eggs just sitting on the court unnoticed, so not going to lie I had my husband close the gate and the older church lady that invited us was guarding the gate. The other kids saw my baby grabbing a few and swarmed like rabid zombies seeing the last surviving human and the older lady harshly said ‚ÄúTHIS IS THE AREA FOR THE BABIES!‚Äù And glared at the parents. There were only 6 eggs in that area

My kid got a whopping 11 eggs. The top five kids all got over 100. 

It wasn‚Äôt about the amount of eggs to me, but his little face as those jerks snatched them from a baby will stick with me for a bit. He looked up at me so confused and said ‚Äúegg?‚Äù It almost made me cry, man. He was so happy with his little 11 eggs though, I think I‚Äôm going to go throw them in our yard after his nap just so he can go collect them again. 

The ‚ÄúEaster bunny‚Äù is leaving eggs in the yard for him tomorrow so he doesn‚Äôt have to compete for them, but I really was hoping he‚Äôd get to go out and play with other little kids and enjoy it. I think I‚Äôm just going to do our own thing from now on and keep it between my kids and maybe the neighbors and my niblings. I can‚Äôt trust the general public to teach their kids manners and how to be unselfish ","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1c0a0r3,"‚ÄúYou dumb ass bitch ass hoe you cunt ass bitch that's why no one like you dumb ass long ass face ass long chin ass lookin like penny wise ass bitch. I hope you fall in a ditch and rot you stupid stinky smelly bitch. Fuck u and your family hoe. Don't nobody like your bitch ass. You suck ass u dumb ass hoe ass fucking retard ass bitch. You dog ass bitch you ugly ass whore you smell like dog shit your coochie smell like lunch meat you built like the fucking Tacoma dome you fuck for a living dumb ass hoe stop talking bout my friends like is stfu bitch‚Äù

*sigh* They are twelve.   The best part. This child goes to a different school.   They went to elementary school together and are now in different middle schools. This message came through out of nowhere. I‚Äôll be calling the school in the morning. 

Editing to answer questions:

I‚Äôm not sure that the school will do much of anything, I‚Äôm just hoping to get someone‚Äôs attention. These schools are blocks apart and in the same district. I called/texted the mother using the the last phone number I had and it went straight to voicemail. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a bad number now.  Kids been blocked but I want to get through to another adult on this. 

Edit #2 (the next day) - I tried the mom‚Äôs number again few more times. Nothing. Despite the interesting debate here on who should do what, I did call the school. They asked  me to come in to sit down with the principal. I explained what was going on. This message arrived during school lunch hours. These girls have a bit of a history with my daughter. The message came through randomly (they haven‚Äôt had contact since the school year started).   

Turns out - the school takes it very seriously. They said they‚Äôd call the parents within the hour. They took screenshots of everything. 

- I just want to reiterate, I tried the parents first. I only went to the school because I had no other option. I know we can block them - I just didn‚Äôt want these kids to get away with saying something like that. You shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to say something so vile and not at least get a call home. 

- For those saying it‚Äôs police business. LOL the police here showed up 8 hours later to my car being stolen out of my driveway. This is an inner city situation.

1bsm2t6,"Husband is a military vet and boasts about needing to own and carry a gun 24/7. Our daughter is 1 and she‚Äôs so curious about everything.

I believe he is a irresponsible gun owner but he thinks he‚Äôs the best of everything. We have a room next door to our daughters and my daughter likes to run in there usually to find her dad. I stepped out to use the bathroom and I hear my daughter open the door to our room. I don‚Äôt hear her walking so I peer my head over to see what she‚Äôs doing.

Little did I know, her father left his loaded gun on the edge of the bed. She grabbed it and smiles at me while I look at her with a knot in my stomach and grab it back from her.

My husband was downstairs doing something. When he came back upstairs, I told him to never put his gun on the edge of the bed. He blames me for not looking after my daughter. And doubles down on not putting it up somewhere safe. He adamantly refuses to purchase or place his gun in a gun safe. And then gets angry at me for ‚Äúnot watching‚Äù our daughter.

1c3gyok,"We‚Äôve had a rough couple of years and our relationship has become strained as a result.

My 17yo daughter is really into hiking, and every morning she wakes up extra early to ride her bike to the nearest trail (about 5 miles). She‚Äôs been doing this for about a year.

This morning she woke me up to let me know that she was about to leave as she usually does. 

After a little while she came back into my room and asked if i wanted to come with her. I was very surprised and a little confused but immediately agreed.

She said she didn‚Äôt want to talk, just wanted to hike and listen to her AirPods. About halfway through my own AirPods died and she offered me one of hers. So we listened to an artist named Ethel Khan, I didn‚Äôt particularly care for the music but the bonding was so heartwarming for me.

Afterwards we went to Panda Express and talked about music for a little bit in the car.

It was really nice, easily the most amount of time we‚Äôve spent together since she was 14 and I hope she‚Äôs up to spend more time together in the future.

1bk6qua,"For context I am the 52 year old dad and she is 18. She told us she was sexually active with her BF so her mom found an ObGyn and made an appt for birth control.

She got the 3 month shot thing. She also requested an exam of her lady parts even though it was not required because she wanted to make sure everything is ok down there.

She has had social anxiety issues and depression in the past so I am hella proud of her!!!

As a dad though I am deeply uncomfortable with everything here. After years of therapy and recovery work my reaction to all this has been healthy. I am not mad or disappointed, I am not angry with her BF and I am very happy we have the kind of relationship where she can talk freely with me. I am just uncomfortable with my daughter being an adult woman.

My kid was really upset. I reached out to the mother about this, and she responded with ""Wow.  I had no idea you lived in my house and that I was married to you!  I said what I said to MY CHILD in MY HOUSE.  Don't tell me how to parent especially when you have zero context.""

It's really sad to me. My kid has felt that this mother hasn't liked them for a few years now (even though they have been best friends since preschool). According to the kids, she feels that my kid isn't cool enough to hang out with hers. I want to protect my child, but didn't want to get in the way of their friendship. Any advice?

1btgza6,"Our 13 year old niece (we'll call her Lizzy) was spending the Easter weekend with us as she is best friends with our 11 year old niece (we'll call her Maya) who we're adopting (their bio moms are both my wife's sisters). Lizzy's mom is currently in prison so she's being raised with her 8 siblings by her pastor stepdad. His church is not a normal church and they don't believe in celebrating holidays.

Since Lizzy was over for Easter, I got her a basket like I got for Maya with a mini squishmallow, body spray, lip oil, a YA novel, etc. She loved the basket and took it with her when she left for school this morning. But just now her stepdad came over and returned the basket saying that Lizzy couldn't have it. He also returned a box of tampons that apparently Maya gave her (I didn't know about it). Maya says it's because Lizzy didn't have any and had to sit out swim class.

Stepdad didn't seem angry or anything and said she could keep the basket at our house for when she visits but he didn't want her to have it at home. I'm not sure if we did anything wrong because he's just a very strange man. Do you think we undermined his parenting? I just didn't want her to feel left out since Maya and our four year old and even our pets got baskets.","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1bnxw53,"I have a 6 (almost 7) year old daughter. She is currently in grade 1. Ever since she started the school year, she has been telling me that the girls in her class leave her out and don‚Äôt really play with her. She also tells me that she spends recess alone because they don‚Äôt include her. In the beginning, she would tell me these things during bedtime when we‚Äôd be laying down together and I always just thought it was partly made up stories and that she was exaggerating everything but I listened to her and tried to find ways to help her out in dealing with these kids. Months pass and she stills tells me almost nightly that she‚Äôs always alone during recess and has cried over it to me several times. Well, the other day I took her to a birthday party and all the girls were there. The girls were running around playing and I saw my daughter ask one of them if she could play with them. The girl looked at her straight in the face, turned around and walked away. I then saw my daughter‚Äôs eyes turn very watery and it just crushed me. I took her hand and I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think your friend heard you?‚Äù And she said ‚Äúno mommy. She looked right at me and ignored me‚Äù. I now know what she tells me about them is true. I saw it happen with my own eyes. 

Again tonight, she told me she was alone during recess today and she started to cry. She asked me if I could get her some crayons and a colouring book for recess so she can sit at the table alone and just colour. üò™üò™

I don‚Äôt understand why none of these girls include her. My daughter is so sweet and loveable and I‚Äôm not just saying that because I‚Äôm her mother. She really is. It‚Äôs just so hard for me to understand why none of these kids include her. 

What can I do to help her? Im heartbroken for her and I‚Äôm at a loss here. ","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1binh83,"5th graders in my son‚Äôs (10yo) do an annual fundraiser selling chocolate bars to fund their 5th grade party at the end of the year. 

The fundraiser is selling chocolate bars for $1 and there‚Äôs 60 bars in a box. He decided the bars were too cheaply priced and decided to sell them for $2 each or 3 for $5. He gave the school their $60 per box and saved the other $40 he made (apparently he made $100 per box). So the school got the $60 per box they were expecting. 

We found out when the school called and let us know. They forced him to give them all of the money since what he did wasn‚Äôt in the ‚Äúspirit of the fundraiser‚Äù. 

When we asked him about it, he told us he went on the company website and looked at all of the rules and there was nothing about marking up the chocolate. He didn‚Äôt understand why the school cared if they‚Äôre getting their $60. 

The school wants us to have a stern talk with him, but honestly I think it was kind of brilliant for a 10 year old lol. The parent in me is a bit embarrassed, but the entrepreneur in me thinks this kid is going places. 

What would you do? 

***edit*** 

I was asked to add some details:

1) my son bought the entire box of chocolates up front from the school for $60 with his own money. 

2) my son did not sell under the guise of a fundraiser. We‚Äôve spoken to several folks he sold to and he did not say it was for the school at all. He took the chocolates out of the fundraiser box and put half in a basket and the other half in a cooler that he pulled with a wagon for people that liked chocolate cold. Kids starting little businesses and selling is super common in our neighborhood so that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt raise any red flags (bracelets, lawn mowing, kool-aid, etc) 

3) he was caught because another kid selling sold to one of his customers and that kid‚Äôs mom called the school 

4) we absolutely had a strong talk with him. I think I can be internally impressed with his mind while still teaching lessons on appropriateness/time & place/ethics to him.

1bkerao,"This might sound weird, but it isn't really common for people to ask me how my day at work was. I always ask my gf, but most of the time I don't get the same question back. A few months ago I mentioned this to her in private but it hasn't really changed anything.
So, we were at the dinner table today. I asked my gf how her day was, we asked the children how their day at school was and they talked about everything that happened. It was quiet for approx 2 minutes while we were eating, and my 4 year old daughter looks at me and she asks, what did you do at work today?
 I was completely stunned, I didn't know what to say because it felt so cute and made me feel so happy. I could see the genuine interest in her eyes. And I started talking about what I had done and she kept looking and nodding.
It's weird but it made me feel so acknowledged and happy. She's becoming a great kid.","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1c2bdau,"My husband (37M) has never liked our son and he told me many times. He never really bonded with our son since he was born. As time went by,  he felt our son 1) cried too much as a baby, 1) had difficulty controlling his own emotions as a toddler and cried too often,  3) was a spoiled brat who didn't care about pleasing the parents 4) is a picky eater 5) is pessimistic in nature. He felt constant disappointment and disliked our son more and more.  We also have a younger daughter he bonded instantly and adores dearly. 

He is a great husband and helps a lot around the house. Aside from numerous chores, he cooks breakfast and dinner and prepares lunch for the kids. However, our son sometimes does not like what he cooks and complains. Yesterday, our son complained that he did not like dinner and asked:""why don't you make things that I like?"" It really hurt my husband's feelings, and he was very angry and scolded him. Then he was so angry that he just shut down and didn't interact with anyone. After the kids were down, my husband told me he disliked our son and never loved him and he was losing hope. 

I felt really hurt and sad that my husband said these things, and I knew he meant it. In my eyes, my son is a sweet, kind little boy. He cries and is sometimes picky about food, but these are all normal 5 yo behaviors. He eats much better than other kids his age and he is tall and strong. He often finishes his food though he does complain if he doesn't like what he eats. I think my husband has unrealistic standards for a 5yo, and these unrealistic standards are making him unhappy, so much so that he can be depressed because of his interaction with our son. 

I asked him to consider seeing a therapist, but he is very resistant to the idea. He said it would be useless because he knew what the therapist would say. He felt the therapist would ask him to change because one can only change yourself. But he said he didn't want to change. It is our son who needs to change.

I don't know what to do. On one hand, I tell myself it is a father-and-son relationship, and it is up to them to maintain the relationship and there isn't much mom can do. This thought saved me from constant agony and disappointment. However, I feel sad for my son that he has a father who doesn't love him and am worried how it would affect him. I feel sorry for my husband too. 

I feel helpless and sometimes depressed because of this. What do I do? Is there something I can do to improve their relationship, or should I just accept it?

1bqvp7s,"My (43f) 11-year old daughter went through puberty early. She developed breast buds at 8 and started her period at 9. She grew 13 inches in one year. Now, she is a 5'3, fully developed young lady, even though she's not even a teen yet. 

This has definitely been an adjustment for me and my spouse (49m). Because she looks much older, I've had to have conversations with her about sex, pedophiles, internet safety, etc. that may not be totally age appropriate. She knows that any adult that asks you to keep secrets from parents or authorities is not a safe adult. Luckily, she's an only child so she's emotionally and intellectually mature, too. 

We are a very close knit, touchy-feely family.  My daughter still enjoys cuddling with us. She'll curl up with me in bed to watch movies or snuggle in her Dad's recliner to watch videos together. She still asks us to tickle her back or play with her hair. She also tends to walk around the house in a tshirt and no pants, despite both of us getting onto her for it. 

Last weekend, we were waiting outside at a restaurant and she was sitting on her Dad's lap. My mom leaned over to me and said they need to stop doing stuff like that in public. At first I brushed it off, but the more I think about it, the more I started to worry. 

I don't want to stop being affectionate with my kid, since she'll soon be old enough that she won't want to snuggle. But I also don't want to give people the wrong idea, especially since she looks so much older. 

What sort of behaviors would be considered inappropriate, both in public and at the house? 

Note 1: I expect there will be many different opinions about this. We are pretty easy going people, but I'm interested in ALL opinions. Please be respectful to each other and respect people's boundaries, even if they are more or less strict than your own. 

Note 2: I believe that anyone can be a pedophile or assault a child. I've seen it happen too much within families and I don't trust even those closest to us. With that knowledge, I am as confident as I can be that my husband would never do anything intentionally inappropriate or sexual with our daughter. If I ever found out otherwise, I'd make Lorena Bobbit look like a nonviolent monk. ","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1bnskdh,"My daughter is now 21 and I found out the past two semesters she was just having fun and didn't attend a single class, withdrawing from all of her classes near the end of the semester so I wouldn't get a refund notification.  When I asked for her grades or how classes were going, she would give me fake info, sending edited photos of grades and making up elaborate lies on what she did in her classes.  She finally came clean when I asked for her Login credentials.

This also happened a couple of years ago when she Failed two semesters (didn't even bother to withdraw) .  I paid for her to go to intensive therapy for a year from age 19-20  and am now shocked that this behavior continues.  This time she did it and by her own admission she was overwhelmingly lazy. The last time this happened she had stated it was because she was depressed.

She did give me a heartfelt, sobbing apology. But she has done this kid of speech the last time she did this, to no change, and I feel like it could be an attempt to manipulate me.

She attends college in another state and I've since withdrawn her from college.

I am a widow and have raised her alone since she was 2.

I'm wanting other parents advice on how they would handle this.   Thank you!

1bhcm95,"UPDATE: He says he is planning to retire by 40. He is also spending extra time working on other jobs like real estate/ timber and has pulled in 100k/ year with that. It takes extra time when he could be coming home for dinner instead. Whenever he spends time with his parents, they give him more money he immediately squirrels away. He says if he doesn't get it his mom will spend it all. He feels he has a right to it and I tell him he needs to stop going after their money; if they want to be irresponsible with it he needs to let it go. I have a feeling he projects his mother onto me and rather than seeing $40 takeout order or Sephora visit, he sees her usual impulse $30k furniture expense. His dad makes 2 mil/ year but is still stuck working because of her asinine financial habits.

He is very angry about being in law and feels like a slave, but no one is making him do this but himself.

He said he's open to the idea of a part time nanny (I was sad he said that instead of just helping out more because I'd rather have him back). But then he asked me what I'd do with the time. The disrespect for housewives runs deep, guys. I made the wrong career choice.

So I have a feeling I'm working overtime for that very ambitious decision. I don't find that fair and will be pursuing counseling to get him to see the light. If that doesn't work, well, I saw your comments and understand what a normal person's viewpoint is. Thanks

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

original post:

More money to spend? I subconsciously take what I'd spend on hiring help and buy things for myself and the kids when I'm angry he's not here. It's usually trips with his dad/ brother, time with his friends, or some trip with his family of origin that is hard for me and very little kids (such as Hawaii). He gets mad if I don't spend the weekend like it's another weekday. For example, ordering take out to make it easier on me while he gets fancy dinners (""but I didn't pay for them"") and fun nights out all the time.

He earns over 400k/ year and I'm a stay at home parent. What, other than counseling, would you be doing about it?

I'm not supposed to just sit at home working 24/7 without getting something for it, am I?","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1c1zphs,"TLDR: My son was throwing a tantrum so my husband ripped up his Pok√©mon cards as a way to get him to stop. It worked, but I‚Äôm not okay with it. Husband thinks he did the right thing. 

My son (8), was recently diagnosed with ADHD and a sensory processing disorder. I (F39) also have ADHD. We both struggle with emotional regulation when we are stressed/overwhelmed/tired/hungry‚Ä¶ you get the idea. My son turns into the hulk and yell and scream. Neither are productive and I am working on me and trying to help my son work on him. 

Well today something set my son off and I could feel that I was not prepared to handle the situation without losing my shit. My husband (41) was chilling on his phone so I asked him to step in. Then I left (went to my office/garage in the backyard) to let my husband takeover while I calmed down a bit. 

According to my husband my son was hitting and kicking him and trying to throw things. Unfortunately that is typical for him when he gets to this point. It probably happens about once a month, maybe twice. 

I usually handle this by taking a time out with my son in his room. I sit in front of the door and tell him we won‚Äôt leave until he is calm and any mess he makes is cleaned up. I won‚Äôt let him break anything either. He hasn‚Äôt tried to hurt me in a long time. The last time he did he lost iPad privileges for a long time and I will remind him of that consequence.

My husband handled it by threatened to rip up his Pok√©mon cards if he didn‚Äôt listen or calm down. He ended up ripping up three cards before my son stopped the tantrum. 

I am so upset with my husband for doing that. To me that is emotional manipulation and abusive. My husband thinks it was his only option to get our son to listen. He thinks I let our son walk all over me and he doesn‚Äôt respect me because I won‚Äôt punish him in any meaningful way. 

I know that kicking, hitting, and throwing things are not acceptable behaviors. But neither is ripping up someone else‚Äôs things. My husband seems to think scaring your child into behaving is teaching them to respect you. I think that‚Äôs an outdated belief and nothing but harmful in the long run. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to my husband but he just disagrees with everything I‚Äôve said. He thinks he was in the right and doesn‚Äôt need to apologize. He‚Äôs just talking to him as if nothing has happened. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, but I‚Äôm so sad for our son. He shouldn‚Äôt have to watch a trusted adult destroy his things. I‚Äôm just so sad. Am I overthinking this?  I don‚Äôt think I am, but my husband has me questioning myself. ","r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

1bioyld,"Edit: I just want to say that I appreciate everyone that's stopped by here to offer words of support and advice, and I want to thank everyone who has been vulnerable and shared your stories of grief and loss. I'm not able to respond to everyone here but I am reading every single comment. Thank you so much. 


OP: My daughter is 13 years old. Yesterday one of her good friends shot and killed himself. My daughter tried to go to school today but I ended up bringing her home. She's just absolutely devastated. I don't know how to help her. She isn't interested in talking to a therapist right now but is open to doing it in the future. I've just been giving her lots of hugs. I gave her any photos I had of the two of them together. And we've shared some tears.

The school is of course saying that this wasn't a bullying situation. And I know the kid had a lot going on at home. But my daughter tells me that on Friday she witnessed another kid tell her friend to go kill himself. So she's rightfully angry about that.

What can I do to support her during this time?

1bgxftl,"So it was Sunday and I was making ramen, the 1$ kind from the store and when I was dropping the noodles into the pot one of the pieces fell a little off from the pot and started burning on the stove and the flame was HUGE on the tiny little piece of ramen and so I called mom over (she was in the living room) and she walked over, then she  picked it up! I said DON'T TOUCH IT!! she walked over to the sink and dropped it there and when I asked her how she did that she said ""I've been cooking longer than you've been alive"". THAT DOES NOT CUT IT.

My mother recalls horrible, simply horrible summers of all the family children working there nonstop. From taking care of the animals to washing everything perfectly to making butter old fashioned way to helping with the small children to weeding the veggie garden. 

Food was served just as much as needed, people had one plate that they needed to wash for themselves and there were no such things as 12 sides and what not served on nice plates and bowls. Meals were simple. Soup. Bread, butter and cheese. Hard boiled eggs and so on. It‚Äôs much easier to wash one plate for yourself and one pot of soup as opposed to what we are used to now- chopping bord, salad bowl, side plates, wine glasses and water glasses, potato dish and so on and then oven sheets, pan and pot, chefs knife and blah blah blah. My grandma literally used one knife to peel the vegetables and would chop the ingredients straight to the pot of soup -no chopping board. 

Windows were cleaned in spring time as well as all the bed linen washed around easter time. All the linens were organized for the following year. Bed linens were washed less often than we do it now especially in winter times. 

It was absolutely expected that everyone in the family will help. Even toddlers were expected to feed the chicks. 

The house was made of wood entirely and that is literally impossible to actually clean. You can mop for sure, but you will not expect to clean all the nooks and crannies. No spider webs and socks don‚Äôt stick? Good enough! Our case is different as we have polished woods and tile that needs to be perfectly perfect.

My grandmother recalls my mother and her twin sister eating earth worms they dug up while tied somewhere in the gardens. Children crying was a total norm. It was considered that alive, fed, dressed and healthy baby is totally enough. They did not know about emotional needs children have, nor they had the time to care.

Long story short, I am the first generation of healed children in that family. Being tied to a tree crying for (possibly) hours definitely made them all insecure, some worse than others. 

Oh and my great grandmother was 16 when she married and got pregnant so it‚Äôs not like she had any capacity to even start understanding complex children psychologically. She knew that as long as a kid is clean and fed she did her job well. As I understand she considered herself a model mother, wife and woman. And I am sure she was. Just if she lived in our times she would go to damn jail for neglect and abandonment of children."
1btuu6g,"Seriously, when I'm out in public, I always carry tissues to wipe my boy's nose. Even if it's just a little drip. And yet I see so many parents that let their kids crawl and waddle around with a river of snot running down their face and in their mouth. Even a kid crying right next to his mom on the train, clearly uncomfortable with the mess on his face and wanting it cleaned off, his mom will just look right at him and try to get play with his tummy or something else to get him to stop crying.

Call me vain if you like, but I can see the looks on other peoples' faces when they see a snot-covered baby face. It's not a kid I'd like to pick up and make laugh, for fear that he gets it all over my clothes and face. And I would never hand my child to friend if he wasn't cleaned up. It's like handing him to someone knowing full well he has a dirty diaper.

  I'm honestly getting tired, and I don't understand the reason for such overreacting. 

 She also was flabbergasted when I said that I was going to do some weight lifting there as well, along with cardio. Started saying I would get bulky and stuff. I had to tell her women who are bulky work very hard for it, and she was surprised, to say the least. 

 Now, I told her I would be going 3 times a week, and she started telling me to go everyday to rip the benefits of it. I had to tell her that it is very unlikely I would stick with the gym if I was going there everyday out of nowhere, as until now I have had a sedentary lifestyle. 

  Not only that, I want to buy snickers to go to the gym, because my old training shoes literally have little holes in them. She told me not to. I feel guilty just by spending my own money.

Please correct me if i‚Äôm wrong. So one of the kids, who is probably around 4/5, goes around hitting people and hurting them. She knows it hurts, like for example i was injured and had my hand bandaged, and this girl comes and starts hitting and pressing it deliberately, but i couldnt say anything because its not my child. And the mom was there but she never stops it, because its not ‚Äúgentle parenting‚Äù.

I get it if kids run around and throw tantrums because thats in kids nature, and they may even be doing this innocently, but if its hurting someone shouldn‚Äôt it be stopped. Like just a ‚Äúno, you are not allowed to do that, even if you want to play‚Äù or ‚Äúthere are other ways you can play‚Äù or something like that?

Anyway, so if kids are doing that, and we arent the parent, even if their parent gets offended can we tell them to stop doing that and its wrong?","That isnt gentle parenting.

1bw6u05,"Neighbors in the house next door have 4 kids. They all seem to be between the ages of 3-7. However, lately I've been hearing one of them crying and screaming like they're being tortured. I understand they're children, and so they may be having a tantrum, but I feel like these screams are like they're being abused. The other day they were playing outside, making a regular amount of noise, but then a parent seemingly called one of them and about 10 minutes later the child was screaming. I can't necessarily tell what was said, the family is Nigerian and super friendly, but you never know what happens behind closed doors. It's possible the kid started crying because he wasn't done playing, but again, they speak in another language so I don't know if that's what they said to him when he went in the house. 

I'm just worried that the child is suffering and being punished. It happens randomly, especially when hes just playing putside. The crying doesn't bother me. It's the way he cries and screams that makes me think he's being hurt, and the thought of a child being hurt is what makes me sick. It usually lasts anywhere from 10-30 minutes. I don't have any kids so that's why I ask.  I don't wanna be the asshole that calls the cops on nice neighbors, but I also want to make sure the child is safe. What do I do here?

1bvqo7w,"My friend (30F) and I (29F) have been very close friends since college. I was a bridesmaid in her wedding, and her son calls me ""auntie"". We live in different cities now, but I try to make it a point to make trips out there to visit when I can (maybe 1-2x/year), and I always preface beforehand that it's up to her, that I know she's got a ton on her plate with the kids and that I could make the visit as short as 2 hours and stay with family nearby.

Admittedly, she's gotten a bit of a complex since becoming a mom. She was the first of our friends to do it, and since then, nothing going on in anyone's lives could possibly be as important as what's going on in hers because HELLO, she's a MOM. We're almost 30, and I'm the only girl in our circle who hasn't met ""the one"" or settled down yet (trust me, I'm working on it). Because of this, I've felt like she's been talking down to me for quite a while now because we're in different stages.

One time I visited her after she had the first baby. When I reached out after I left and told her how happy I was to see them and how wonderful her son is, rather than thanking me for coming, she replied ‚Äúso glad you could experience the sacrifices of parenting for a day lol.‚Äù That one stung. When she got pregnant with her second baby, I mentioned possibly making a trip out a few months after her due date to come meet the baby. She immediately launched into a lecture about how she needed to set boundaries and that she loved me but needed more time before having visitors (even though I thought a few months would be enough). I totally understood and wanted to give her space, but I wished it had come out differently and hadn't sounded like a lecture.

Here's the thing-- baby was born a few weeks back, and she's already had several visitors (including some mutual friends). We've never really argued, and I think she's an amazing mom, but it feels like she treats me differently because I'm not married or at the stage in life that her other friends are. I really don't think she means to and I don't think she's trying to send me a message or not keep me around, but she's just unaware of how she comes off. Then again, I'm not sure anymore. I thought we were closer than this and she's never given me reason to believe otherwise (still FaceTimes me on a regular basis, still shoots inside jokes with me back and forth, etc.). We really are close, and the only difference between me and these other friends of hers is, unfortunately, that they're married women.

I feel like I'm always sending the kids gifts, going out of my way to be part of their lives, etc. and yes, it's starting to feel like she prefers the friends of ours who are married and have kids because she can relate more. I can't really blame her for that, but I wish it didn't come out in such obvious and hurtful ways. This whole thing about not wanting visitors too soon and then having several people come over weeks after the baby was born was kind of the final straw for me.

Should I call her out and tell her how I feel? Do I just need to let it go because she has too much on her plate with the chaos that is parenthood and I shouldn't make this about me?","Honestly, this reads more to me like you're more invested in the friendship than she is.",49,2024-04-04,r/AskParents,friend f f close friend since college bridesmaid wedding son call auntie live different city try make point make trip visit maybe x year always preface beforehand know get ton plate kid could make visit short hour stay family nearby admittedly get bit complex since become mom first friend since nothing go anyone life could possibly important go hello mom almost girl circle meet one settle yet trust working feel like talk quite different stage one time visit first baby reach leave tell happy see wonderful son rather thank come reply glad could experience sacrifice parenting day lol one stung get pregnant second baby mention possibly make trip month due date come meet baby immediately launch lecture need set boundary love need time visitor even though think month would enough totally understand want give space wish come differently sound like lecture thing baby bear week back already several visitor include mutual friend never really argue think amazing mom feel like treat differently married stage life friend really think mean think try send message keep around unaware come sure anymore think close never give reason believe otherwise still facetime regular basis still shoot inside joke back forth etc really close difference friend unfortunately married woman feel like always send kid gift go way part live etc yes start feel like prefer friend marry kid relate really blame wish come obvious hurtful way whole thing want visitor soon several people come week baby bear kind final straw call tell feel need let go much plate chaos parenthood make,honestly read like invest friendship,friend f f close friend since college bridesmaid wedding son call auntie live different city try make point make trip visit maybe x year always preface beforehand know get ton plate kid could make visit short hour stay family nearby admittedly get bit complex since become mom first friend since nothing go anyone life could possibly important go hello mom almost girl circle meet one settle yet trust working feel like talk quite different stage one time visit first baby reach leave tell happy see wonderful son rather thank come reply glad could experience sacrifice parenting day lol one stung get pregnant second baby mention possibly make trip month due date come meet baby immediately launch lecture need set boundary love need time visitor even though think month would enough totally understand want give space wish come differently sound like lecture thing baby bear week back already several visitor include mutual friend never really argue think amazing mom feel like treat differently married stage life friend really think mean think try send message keep around unaware come sure anymore think close never give reason believe otherwise still facetime regular basis still shoot inside joke back forth etc really close difference friend unfortunately married woman feel like always send kid gift go way part live etc yes start feel like prefer friend marry kid relate really blame wish come obvious hurtful way whole thing want visitor soon several people come week baby bear kind final straw call tell feel need let go much plate chaos parenthood make honestly read like invest friendship,neutral,"If I could go back I‚Äôd just ask for more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so exhausted, can you bring food from x?

A child will change everything. Your whole life will revolve around them. Yes you can take them with you with a lot of things. But you‚Äôll always think about their needs first.

Ofcourse having kids is not only bad. Every morning I get a very cute ‚Äò hi mommy, how did you sleep?‚Äô.

He has my weird sense of humor, has a smile that lights up a room and when he cries I want to rip my heart out because it hurts so much.

1bsxp7m,"So [I made a post recently about how my 27 year old coworker and I both talk about movies a lot and he told our coworker he put in his two weeks as a joke and I was so devastated when I heard this I started crying](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1bgxr5f/coworkerfriend_27m_made_me_17f_cry_how_should_i/?share_id=Uk55-h4us0bNRiNwA0ZMw&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). So I‚Äôll give an update.

I talked to my therapist about it and he echoed what a lot of people in the comments said how I‚Äôm mixing work and pleasure and I should assert boundaries. I came in to work this morning and was on the schedule at the same time and I was ready to talk to him, and we were both behind the counter together and were the only ones there this morning so we had some privacy while still being in open view of the theater.

I told him I was sorry I got so emotional since it was unprofessional of me and I said I really enjoy talking with him about movies but I still want to maintain professionalism. He said he talked to his wife about it and he wanted to say something similar since (‚Äúto call a spade a spade‚Äù) it‚Äôs not normal to run into the back and cry when you find out a coworker is leaving. He also said he was gonna let me in on a secret and let me know, he‚Äôs job hunting for something else since AMC Theaters can‚Äôt support a baby and wife so he likely wont be there for much longer. I promised I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone but we came to an agreement that we‚Äôd just be coworkers. We did talk about movies a bit but it was professional.

I‚Äôm autistic and my special interest is movies and he‚Äôs the only person in my life who watches movies so I have a hard time not talking to him on and off the clock about movies. Honestly, movies is the only way I can connect with people and my dad doesn‚Äôt get them and he‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve talked to IRL who‚Äôs liked movies like me so I got attached, I‚Äôll admit. Even now, I want to talk to him about movies but I don‚Äôt want to overstep and text him or talk too much to him on the clock.

1bmaoll,"My brother-in-law is 26. He's become very religious in the past two years, following his church's strict teachings to a T. He has a toddler who's almost two, and a baby just 6 months old. Even before his toddler was born, he was already talking about hitting and spanking them (because it says to in the bible), and he has now begun doing that. 

He and his mother have been arguing a lot about it, and she's often in tears because his arguments are so unreasonable, and he's so devoted to God instead of his children. I heard him say ""Who should I love more, my children or God? It has to be God."" He also argues that he himself was a bad kid and would have been jailed if his father didn't lay hands on him.

Frankly, he doesn't have a lot of critical thinking skills, and I'm not sure science would convince him. How can I as a mere in-law, younger than him, nonreligious and childless, possibly change his mind? His toddler is the sweetest, most precious child. She doesn't deserve what's happening to her. Are there any religious parents here who have faith-compliant non-violent parenting practices? Or any former corporal punishment users who have changed their mind?

My mother recalls horrible, simply horrible summers of all the family children working there nonstop. From taking care of the animals to washing everything perfectly to making butter old fashioned way to helping with the small children to weeding the veggie garden. 

Food was served just as much as needed, people had one plate that they needed to wash for themselves and there were no such things as 12 sides and what not served on nice plates and bowls. Meals were simple. Soup. Bread, butter and cheese. Hard boiled eggs and so on. It‚Äôs much easier to wash one plate for yourself and one pot of soup as opposed to what we are used to now- chopping bord, salad bowl, side plates, wine glasses and water glasses, potato dish and so on and then oven sheets, pan and pot, chefs knife and blah blah blah. My grandma literally used one knife to peel the vegetables and would chop the ingredients straight to the pot of soup -no chopping board. 

Windows were cleaned in spring time as well as all the bed linen washed around easter time. All the linens were organized for the following year. Bed linens were washed less often than we do it now especially in winter times. 

It was absolutely expected that everyone in the family will help. Even toddlers were expected to feed the chicks. 

The house was made of wood entirely and that is literally impossible to actually clean. You can mop for sure, but you will not expect to clean all the nooks and crannies. No spider webs and socks don‚Äôt stick? Good enough! Our case is different as we have polished woods and tile that needs to be perfectly perfect. 

She breastfed and co-slept with all her children. Unfortunately, babies were also tied to trees while left alone while she was working. That was the way of keeping them ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. My grandmother recalls my mother and her twin sister eating earth worms they dug up while tied somewhere in the gardens. Children crying was a total norm. It was considered that alive, fed, dressed and healthy baby is totally enough. They did not know about emotional needs children have, nor they had the time to care.

Long story short, I am the first generation of healed children in that family. Being tied to a tree crying for (possibly) hours definitely made them all insecure, some worse than others. 

Oh and my great grandmother was 16 when she married and got pregnant so it‚Äôs not like she had any capacity to even start understanding complex children psychologically. She knew that as long as a kid is clean and fed she did her job well. As I understand she considered herself a model mother, wife and woman. And I am sure she was. Just if she lived in our times she would go to damn jail for neglect and abandonment of children."

1bs6pwc,"I‚Äôm 24m, my dad started dating this woman a year ago. I knew right off the hop she was pretty full of herself. She owns a trendy store in town, she‚Äôs somewhat good looking, obsessed with social media and thinks her children are gods gifts to this earth. Didn‚Äôt really care though. We got along just fine and she was good for my dad so whatever, fast forward a year and I can tell she looks at my girlfriend and I as if we are dirt. 

Most of my family is really successful. All of my uncles are extremely well off, and so are my cousins. I‚Äôm not, nor is my girlfriend. We do OK and we are fine with that. I think that is the issue here, she sees us as lesser beings.

Just in the past week we had a small bday get together for her before her real bday party since my brother was in town. Literally just 5 of us. I brought the old family dog that my dad used to take care of, he‚Äôs old and kinda smelly but whatever. We were upstairs at my *dads* house and my dog jumped on the couch. She looked over and yelled ‚Äúget that dog off the fucking couch!‚Äù It completely threw me off guard. Who tf yells at their boyfriend‚Äôs 24 year old?? I didn‚Äôt even know what to say. 

A day later she texted and asked if we were free for Easter breakfast with her and my dad. I texted back and said how about Sunday? She ignored me and has yet to text back. Thursday rolls around and I get a text from my cousin at 8PM asking where I am. I asked him what he meant and he replied ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all at your dad‚Äôs for *gf‚Äôs* birthday party? Where are you?‚Äù 

My dad mentioned throwing a small get together for her on her actual birthday a week before. I asked him who was going and he said just a few of her girlfriends. Apparently most of my family was there; 10-15 people, plus a ton of her friends. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do in this situation. My dad is becoming increasingly distant I‚Äôm assuming because his gf doesn‚Äôt want us associating. Should I just ignore this and move on with my life, or should I confront my dad and tell him how I feel

1bpcqwh,"I am currently 19, turning 20 this year. I am working towards my Associate‚Äôs Degree taking 5 classes (18 units, full-time student) as well as work 4 days a week (32 hours). At the moment I‚Äôm trying to save up to move out to a new apartment across the state and attend university there, where tuition and student fees are about $15-17K a year.. not including books, food plan, rent etc‚Ä¶

My parents are currently charging rent to live in a smaller room (barely fits a 47‚Äù desk and a twin bed). At the moment they charge me around $700 a month or more depending on groceries. 

I feel that this is unfair given the amount of work I am currently doing. Unfortunately I have not been able to work on my portfolio and passions because I spend the first week for school and the second part of the week for work. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to them but they seem pretty adamant about charging me rent. I understand that it‚Äôs not a lot per se, but from my understanding they will not be helping me with any school expenses in the future, even though they‚Äôre quite well off.

Edit: I also wanted to add a couple things ‚Äì neither of parents‚Äôs parents had ever made them pay for rent. I also moved into a smaller room because they were already charging me $1500.00 a month (which at that point, is basically a room in an apartment alone where I live). They‚Äôre trying to instill financial freedom and literacy but I think it‚Äôs a bit counterintuitive. They are also not going to support me when I‚Äôm in University.

Follow up q: If I can‚Äôt change my situation, how can I get them to report my payments so that I can get a better credit score?

We come from a rough neighborhood so we try to live based on what we got and I work two jobs to help out my parents. My little brother is 5 yo and doesn't speak English nor is he potty trained in anyway, I realized that by the age of 3-4 he may be autistic because of that and now that he's 5 it‚Äôs very clear. He can express his emotions with random words or just sounds but he can't speak English at all and we took him to doctors and also took away his tablet as well so he could pay more attention to us speaking to try and pick up English. I also try teaching him words and i got him to say 2-3 colors and i try to potty train him as well but I'm not a parent so i don't know what I'm supposed to do and my parents work too much to realize all this so I'm left alone to try and teach him all these things. I'm jus worried because he starts kindergarten in August and he can't speak, he's very rough with other kids, and he isn't potty trained. Any help or suggestions will.
